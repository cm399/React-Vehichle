# Requirement 

Create a React App that allows for a user to configure a vehicle, having the following inputs:

1) Color

   Blue

   Red

   Yellow

2) Type

   Truck

   Van

3) Camper-Addon

   Yes

   No

Use TypeScipt and interfaces. 

As the user configures an input, the image should change to match the configuration. For the
camper-addon, you can affix a simple rectangle to the top of the vehicle.
For the images, you can use any asset or CSS of your choosing.

When the user submits the form, a new page should appear showing a summary of the
configuration and price.

Use the following data to compute price:
 truckBase: 10000
 vanBase: 15000
 BluePaint: 2000
 YellowPaint: 25000
 RedPaint: 30000
 camperAddon: 10000
